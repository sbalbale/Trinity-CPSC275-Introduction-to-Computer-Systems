/**
 * Using recursion, write a C function:

void dec2bin(unsigned int n);

This function accepts a non-negative integer n as a parameter and prints its binary representation. 
You may not use the %b format specifier in printf; instead, construct the binary output manually. 
Using this function, write a C program named convert.c that reads a non-negative integer from standard input and prints its binary representation.
